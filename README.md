# Site24x7 Cleaner
## Description
This is a small python script used to delete all the down monitors in Site24x7, since it's so tedious to do it manually in their Web interface.
Don't be an idiot, make sure that you really want to remove all of the down monitors before proceeding, otherwise you'll lose some legit monitors.
Use at you own risk.

## Usage
Simply run the command :
```
python site24x7-cleaner.py
```

And follow the instructions. You'll be fine.
